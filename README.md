<h3>MRT in Northern Taiwan</h3>
Mass Raid Transit is a fascinating thing to me. And I love extracting information from the daily/monthly transportation volume and transforming it into graphics.

This is a practice integrating R and PowerBI, presenting trends and statistics of MRT transportation volume in northern Taiwan.

Feel free to reach out to me and enjoy it!
